# RaceAI

A personal project to create a self-driving car using evolutionary machin learning and neural networks.

## Video

## Features

- A track editor
- Configuration of population and reproduction process
- Player controlled car

## Techniques Used

- Evolutionary machine learning
- Multi-layer perceptron neural network
- Gradient descent

## Notes

- The neural network is trained to drive on the track.
  - It is not fast.
  - There are instances where it will stop driving forward.
- The neural network is not trained to make sharp turns.
  - It can at most make a around 120 degree turn if the turn is wide enough.
  - It can generally make a 90 degree turn safely.
